# Electronic Medical Records (EMR) Management System

A comprehensive EMR Management System built with Python (FastAPI) backend and React frontend. This system allows healthcare providers to manage patient records, doctor information, and appointments through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Patient Management**: Add, update, delete, and retrieve patient records
- **Doctor Management**: Store and manage doctor details
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Create, update, and track appointments
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- **JSON Storage**: Uses JSON files for data storage instead of a database
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger for easy API interaction
- **Responsive UI**: Modern, responsive interface built with React Bootstrap

## System Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

### Backend (FastAPI)

- RESTful API endpoints for patients, doctors, and appointments
- JSON file-based storage for data persistence
- JWT authentication for secure access
- Comprehensive API documentation with Swagger UI

### Frontend (React)

- Modern, responsive UI built with React and Bootstrap
- Form validation with Formik and Yup
- State management with React Context API
- Secure authentication with JWT tokens

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14.x or higher
- npm 6.x or higher

### Installation and Setup

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd emr_system-main/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the backend server:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

6. The API will be available at http://localhost:8003
7. API documentation is available at http://localhost:8003/docs

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd emr_system-main/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. The application will be available at http://localhost:3003

## Default Admin User

The system comes with a default admin user:
- Username: admin
- Password: password

# Reminder: Instructions for Tool Use

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<tool_name>

For example:

<attempt_completion>

Always adhere to this format for all tool uses to ensure proper parsing and execution.

# Next Steps

If you have completed the user's task, use the attempt_completion tool.

   - Started the React frontend server on port 3003

4. Fixed an issue in the start_servers.bat file:
   - Updated the frontend port from 3002 to 3003 to match the actual port configured in package.json

The EMR system is now running with:
- Backend server: http://localhost:8003
- Frontend application: http://localhost:3003

You can access the application by opening http://localhost:3003 in your browser. The API documentation is available at http://localhost:8003/docs.
