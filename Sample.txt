Still issue not resolved, still seeing all 50 specs executed on each of the 12 nodes using above yml files.Can we integrate below code if useful  

- name: Run Cypress tests in parallel
        env:
          CYPRESS_GROUP: ${{ matrix.runner-number }}
          CYPRESS_PARALLEL: true
        run: npx cypress run --record --key <your_cypress_cloud_key> --ci-build-id ${{ github.sha }} --parallel --group ${{ matrix.runner-number }}

fix the issue and provide updated 



Cypress Cloud automatically:

Fetches the full list of specs.

Distributes them intelligently across available nodes (12 in your case).

Avoids duplicate executions.

Cypress Cloud will now automatically detect all 50 spec files.

Divide them smartly across 12 nodes.

No duplication â€” each spec runs on only one node.

Handles retries if configured in your project.
